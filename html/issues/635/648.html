<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>Abstract:</strong> The problem of personality
in philosophy has been significant since the emergence of Christianity. In
Soviet Russia, this problem has been actualized since the 2nd half of the
twentieth century, since the Thaw, when the books of Russian religious
philosophers became known. We were the original heirs of Christian ontology and
ethics, which assumed that a personal appeal to God on You (Tu) testified to a
change of places in the interior of being itself, which becomes intimate,
close, because the infinite God, being in a person, makes him the same infinite
person.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>The Latin term "persona"
is translated as "mask" (personality). V.V. Vinogradov in the
"History of Words" says that the word "personality",
associated with Latin and Greek meanings (persona, prosopon), was not used
massively in the Old Russian language until the XVII century, and in the XVII
and XVIII centuries it began to denote only the official position of a person.
It is impossible to associate this meaning of the face with what was in antiquity
and the Middle Ages. This is a homonym.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Reflecting on Greek literature, S.
S. Averintsev wrote that the term "creativity" is poorly applicable
to the Greek philosophers: "poyesis" is a matter understood as an
invention. The Greeks invented an objectified type of
communication-through-literature, i.e. dialogue, consciously separated from
life communication. Dialogue as an invention revealed the fundamental
undialogical nature of Greek literature, and Socrates is the ideal of a
radically undialogical person who cannot be internally hurt by the word of the
interlocutor. Therefore, for Averintsev, a personality is a mind free from a
"dialogical situation", it is a mask, an individual understood as an
eidos. It is the mask — "immobile-clear, fully revealed and appeared"
— that is the semantic limit of a continuously emerging face. By opening the
"mask", the Greeks emphasized the importance of individuality.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>V. S. Bybler, criticizing
Averintsev, argues that dialogue is not a construction, it is an internal dispute
of the philosopher taking place in his own soul. He is in the thought itself,
pushing its definitions to the limit and reaching the border of other possible
definitions, concepts, understandings. According to Bybler, the thought itself
is dialogical, communicating with itself within itself and forming a gap
between itself and the other "I". At the same time, Bibler defines
his philosophy as the philosophy of an eternally borderline culture. Dialogue
is a tense collaboration between an author who worked in a past culture and a
reader who lives in a modern culture. Personality for the Bibler is the
ultimate embodiment of the individual — the reverse course of Averintsev.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>M. Ya. Gefter and V. V. Bibikhin
worked out this problem 20 years later. Gefter, based on the unmotivated
appearance of homo sapiens and the unexplained appearance of speech, emphasized
that speech destroyed the limit of understanding between people. This is also
connected with his reliance on the concept of the World of Worlds and the definition
of personality, which, in his opinion, is not a higher form built over the
individual, but a later phenomenon that entered into a dispute with
individuation. Personality is a choice, a form of overcoming oneself with
access to others, a case.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Bibikhin, not agreeing with the
theoretical positions of Averintsev and Bybler, turns out to be closer to
Gefter. It does not proceed from the development of the individual or
personality, having changed the aspect of reasoning. He posed the problem of
the wholeness of a human (homo) who initially deals not with knowledge, but
with being and non-being. Before knowledge there is affirmation and negation,
which sound in speaking silence before any speech and push a person to act. A
human (homo), i.e. not an individual or a person, begins with an act; he is,
first of all, such an act. The difference between Bibikhin's approach, which is
closely related to the ideas of hesychasm, from Averintsev and Bybler lies in
his understanding of philosophy as timeless. For him, everything known is the
World, not even modernity. Personal properties (prosopon) are possessed only by
God, who is "personal" and "hypostatic", because He
expresses energy. This problem of the action of the energetic Word is the most
important witness of the world given through man and recognized through
language. Language poses the problem of understanding, assuming an initial
misunderstanding between people.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;">
